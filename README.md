[Plan - 90 days ](https://www.notion.so/1ff889aa534b4d369c9e69f5c4034eeb)

# Motivation

To replace the legacy Support Portal by developing a new Web Portal for the Support Team, where Syft customers will be able to authenticate into the application in order to Log new Cases ( Tickets ) and see the current status of opened cases. 

This Portal is part of the Syft Website, built with Nextjs Framework. It's an integration with the Salesforce Account (customers) and Service (cases) module. 

## Legacy Portal

The legacy system was generated by the old version of Salesforce. The support team needs to switch to the classic Salesforce version to generate a login and password manually and send it by email ( definitely it's not a good practice ). Customers aren't able to see the status of open cases, only log a new one and communicate with the support team via email. 

## Tech Stack

1. NextJS ( Server Side Rendering ) 
2. Auth0 or Next-auth
3. JSforce
4. Olark Live Chat
5. the View layer is an extension of Syft's Website ( NextJS and TailwindCSS )

# Functional Requirements

1. Web Application
2. Replicate Salesforce Account database
3. Manage users
    1. Create and send link to create new account
    2. change password
    3. Allow Support Manager to manage all users ( manage CRUD )
4. GET cases from Salesforce Cases module
5. Authenticate users

# Non-Functional Requirements

1. Manage about 300 customers
2. Not mission critical, however, massive salesforce licence savings.
3. Salesforce REST api 
4. Data volume is low ( under 1gb );
